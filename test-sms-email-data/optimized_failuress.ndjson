{"_source_id": "7", "batch_id": 7, "input": {"id": "7", "channel": "sms", "sender": "AX-PHONPE-S", "subject": null, "body": "ICCL ZERODHA COIN has requested money from you on PhonePe.Rs.2500 will be debited from your account on approving the request - https://phone.pe/PHONPE/jw0y3sx7", "date": "2025-07-02T23:17:38.160", "type": "SmsMessageKind.received"}, "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided an SMS message and wants me to parse it into a structured JSON according to the given rules. Let me start by understanding the input.\n\nThe SMS body says: \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN has requested money from you on PhonePe.Rs.2500 will be debited from your account on approving the request - https://phone.pe/PHONPE/jw0y3sx7\". The date is 2025-07-02T23:17:38.160. The sender is AX-PHONPE-S, and the type is received.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the transaction type. The message mentions that money is being requested, and the amount will be debited upon approval. According to the classification rules, if it's a payment request, the message_intent should be \"payment_request\", and transaction_type should be omitted. So, I'll set message_intent to \"payment_request\".\n\nNext, the amount is Rs.2500. I need to extract that as a number without commas. So, 2500. The currency is INR by default.\n\nThe transaction_date should be the input date unless there's an explicit date in the body. The body doesn't have a date, so I'll use the provided ISO date.\n\nFor the account, the sender is AX-PHONPE-S, but the account number isn't mentioned. The rules say to preserve masked formats, but since there's no account number here, maybe the account field isn't needed. Wait, the account field is optional except for currency. Wait, no, the output JSON requires currency, but other fields are optional. Wait, looking back: the output JSON has \"currency\" as required, but other fields are optional. So, account is optional. Since there's no account info, maybe omit it.\n\nCounterparty is the person requesting money, which is \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\". But the sender is AX-PHONPE-S, which might be the service provider. Wait, the sender is the one sending the SMS, which in this case is PhonePe. The counterparty here is the person who requested money, which is \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\".\n\nCategory: Since it's a payment request, maybe the category isn't clear. The rules say to use context. Since it's a request for money, perhaps the category is \"other\" or maybe \"transfer\". But the user might not have specified. Let me check the category options. The category includes \"transfer\" as an option. So maybe \"transfer\" is appropriate here.\n\nTags: Maybe \"payment_request\", \"PhonePe\", \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\". But the user said 2-5 short tags. Let's see. The message is about a payment request on PhonePe, so tags could be [\"payment_request\", \"PhonePe\", \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\"].\n\nSummary: \"Payment request for Rs.2500 from ICCL ZERODHA COIN\". That's under 10 words.\n\nConfidence score: Since it's a clear payment request, maybe 0.95.\n\nMetadata: The channel is SMS, sender is AX-PHONPE-S. The method isn't specified, but the sender is PhonePe, which might use UPI or IMPS. But since it's a request, maybe the method is \"Other\". The reference_id could be the URL part, like \"jw0y3sx7\". The original_text is the body.\n\nWait, the rules say for payment requests, include amount but omit transaction_type. So the amount is present, but transaction_type is not. Also, the message_intent is \"payment_request\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have:\n\n- transaction_type: omitted\n- amount: 2500\n- currency: INR\n- transaction_date: 2025-07-02T23:17:38.160\n- counterparty: \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\"\n- category: \"transfer\"\n- tags: [\"payment_request\", \"PhonePe\", \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\"]\n- summary: \"Payment request for Rs.2500 from ICCL ZERODHA COIN\"\n- confidence_score: 0.95\n- message_intent: \"payment_request\"\n- metadata: {channel: \"sms\", sender: \"AX-PHONPE-S\", method: \"Other\", reference_id: \"jw0y3sx7\", original_text: \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN has requested money from you on PhonePe.Rs.2500 will be debited from your account on approving the request - https://phone.pe/PHONPE/jw0y3sx7\"}\n\nWait, the method isn't specified. The sender is PhonePe, which might use UPI, but since it's a request, maybe the method is \"Other\". Alternatively, since the transaction is a request, maybe the method isn't applicable. But the rules say to include method as IMPS, NEFT, etc. Since the message is a request, perhaps the method isn't known, so maybe leave it as \"Other\" or omit. But the metadata requires method. Hmm. The rules say to include method as IMPS | NEFT | UPI | etc. Since the sender is PhonePe, which uses UPI, maybe the method is \"UPI\". But the message is a request, not the actual transaction. However, the metadata's method is for the transaction method. Since the actual transaction hasn't happened yet, maybe the method isn't applicable. But the rules don't specify that. Maybe it's safe to put \"Other\" or leave it out. Wait, the output JSON's metadata has method as optional. Wait, looking back: the output JSON's metadata includes method as a field. The rules say to include method as IMPS | NEFT | UPI | etc. Since the message is a payment request, the method might be UPI if it's through PhonePe. So maybe method is \"UPI\".\n\nAlso, the reference_id could be the URL part after the domain, like \"jw0y3sx7\".\n\nSo, putting all that together, the final JSON should have the fields as discussed.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"amount\": 2500,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"transaction_date\": \"2025-07-02T23:17:38.160\",\n  \"counterparty\": \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\",\n  \"category\": \"transfer\",\n  \"tags\": [\"payment_request\", \"PhonePe\", \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN\"],\n  \"summary\": \"Payment request for Rs.2500 from ICCL ZERODHA COIN\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"message_intent\": \"payment_request\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"channel\": \"sms\",\n    \"sender\": \"AX-PHONPE-S\",\n    \"method\": \"UPI\",\n    \"reference_id\": \"jw0y3sx7\",\n    \"original_text\": \"ICCL ZERODHA COIN has requested money from you on PhonePe.Rs.2500 will be debited from your account on approving the request - https://phone.pe/PHONPE/jw0y3sx7\"\n  }\n}"}

The user provided an SMS message and wants me to parse it into a structured JSON according to the LifafaV0 rules. Let me start by understanding the input.\n\nFirst, the input JSON has the channel as \"sms\", sender as \"AX-ATMSBI-S\", and the body of the message. The body mentions a withdrawal of Rs.10000 from an ATM, with details like the account number, date, transaction number, and available balance. The date in the message is \"02Jul25\", which I need to convert to ISO 8601. The original date in the input is \"2025-07-02T18:03:25.287\", but the body has \"02Jul25\". The rule says to use the input date unless the body has an explicit date. Wait, the rule says to use the input ISO date unless the body has an explicit unambiguous date. So here, the body has \"02Jul25\", which is July 2, 2025. But the input date is already 2025-07-02. So maybe the body's date is the same as the input date. But the input date is in the message, so perhaps the transaction_date should be the input date. Wait, the rule says: \"Dates: use input ISO date unless body has explicit unambiguous date\". So if the body has a date, use that. But the body's date is \"02Jul25\", which is July 2, 2025. The input date is \"2025-07-02T18:03:25.287\". So the body's date is the same as the input date's date part. So the transaction_date should be \"2025-07-02\" as per the body's date. Wait, but the input date is already in ISO format. The rule says to use the input date unless the body has an explicit date. So if the body has a date, use that. But the body's date is \"02Jul25\", which is not in ISO format. So maybe the transaction_date should be the input date's date part. Wait, the input date is \"2025-07-02T18:03:25.287\", so the date part is \"2025-07-02\". The body's date is \"02Jul25\", which is the same as \"2025-07-02\". So the transaction_date should be \"2025-07-02\".\n\nNext, the transaction type. The message says \"Rs.10000 withdrawn at UBI ATM PBGE0110\". According to the classification rules, \"withdrawn\" is a debit. So transaction_type is \"debit\".\n\nAmount is Rs.10000, which is 10000.00. The currency is INR as per the default.\n\nThe account number is \"A/cX9855\", which should be preserved as is. The bank is \"SBI\" since the sender is \"AX-ATMSBI-S\", which likely refers to SBI's ATM. So the account object would have \"bank\": \"SBI\" and \"account_number\": \"A/cX9855\".\n\nCounterparty is \"UBI ATM PBGE0110\". Wait, the sender is \"AX-ATMSBI-S\", which is the ATM, but the counterparty here is the ATM location. But the message says \"withdrawn at UBI ATM PBGE0110\", so the counterparty is \"UBI ATM PBGE0110\".\n\nBalance is \"Available Balance Rs.26623.62\", so balance is 26623.62.\n\nCategory: This is a withdrawal from an ATM, so category should be \"atm-withdrawal\".\n\nTags: Maybe \"ATM withdrawal\", \"SBI\", \"UBI ATM\".\n\nSummary: \"Rs.10000 withdrawn from SBI account at UBI ATM\".\n\nConfidence score: The message is clear about the withdrawal, so confidence is 0.95.\n\nMessage intent: The message is an alert about an ATM withdrawal, so message_intent is \"alert\" or \"transaction\"? Wait, the rules say for ATM Alerts: message_intent=\"alert\" for informational, \"transaction\" for actual withdrawals. Since this is an alert about a withdrawal, maybe message_intent is \"alert\". Wait, the message is informing about a withdrawal that happened, so it's an alert. But the actual transaction is the withdrawal. Wait, the rules say: \"ATM Alerts: message_intent=\"alert\" for informational, \"transaction\" for actual withdrawals\". So if the message is about an actual withdrawal, message_intent is \"transaction\". But the message is informing the user that their card was used, so it's an alert. Hmm. The original message is an alert about a withdrawal. So message_intent should be \"alert\".\n\nMetadata: The method is \"ATM\". The reference_id is the transaction number \"518318029116\". The original_text is the body of the message.\n\nWait, the sender is \"AX-ATMSBI-S\", which is the ATM, so the sender in metadata is \"AX-ATMSBI-S\". The method is \"ATM\".\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ntransaction_type: debit\namount: 10000\ncurrency: INR\ntransaction_date: 2025-07-02\naccount: {bank: \"SBI\", account_number: \"A/cX9855\"}\ncounterparty: \"UBI ATM PBGE0110\"\nbalance: 26623.62\ncategory: \"atm-withdrawal\"\ntags: [\"ATM withdrawal\", \"SBI\", \"UBI ATM\"]\nsummary: \"Rs.10000 withdrawn from SBI account at UBI ATM\"\nconfidence_score: 0.95\nmessage_intent: \"alert\"\nmetadata: {\n  channel: \"sms\",\n  sender: \"AX-ATMSBI-S\",\n  method: \"ATM\",\n  reference_id: \"518318029116\",\n  original_text: \"Dear SBI Customer, Rs.10000 withdrawn at UBI ATM PBGE0110 from A/cX9855 on 02Jul25 Transaction Number 518318029116.

Call 18001234 if cash not received.\"\n}\n\nWait, but the original_text should be the verbatim body. The body is \"Dear SBI Customer, Rs.10000 withdrawn at UBI ATM PBGE0110 from A/cX9855 on 02Jul25 Transaction Number 518318029116. Available Balance Rs.26623.62.

Wait, the input date is \"2025-07-02T18:03:25.287\", but the body's date is \"02Jul25\", which is the same date. So the transaction_date should be \"2025-07-02\".\n\nCheck if all fields are present. The required field is currency, which is present. The other fields are optional but included where possible.\n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"transaction_type\": \"debit\",\n  \"amount\": 10000,\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"transaction_date\": \"2025-07-02\",\n  \"account\": {\n    \"bank\": \"SBI\",\n    \"account_number\": \"A/cX9855\"\n  },\n  \"counterparty\": \"UBI ATM PBGE0110\",\n  \"balance\": 26623.62,\n  \"category\": \"atm-withdrawal\",\n  \"tags\": [\"ATM withdrawal\", \"SBI\", \"UBI ATM\"],\n  \"summary\": \"Rs.10000 withdrawn from SBI account at UBI ATM\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95,\n  \"message_intent\": \"alert\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"channel\": \"sms\",\n    \"sender\": \"AX-ATMSBI-S\",\n    \"method\": \"ATM\",\n    \"reference_id\": \"518318029116\",\n    \"original_text\": \"Dear SBI Customer, Rs.10000 withdrawn at UBI ATM PBGE0110 from A/c"}
