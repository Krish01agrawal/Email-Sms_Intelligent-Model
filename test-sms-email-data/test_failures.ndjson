{"_source_id": "15", "input": {"id": "15", "channel": "sms", "sender": "JX-CULTFT-P", "subject": null, "body": "Hey Divyam\nYour Cultpass payment is still pending. Complete your checkout now and unlock benefits.\nhttps://cure.app.link/aTMSGxayiUb", "date": "2025-07-02T11:36:36.235", "type": "SmsMessageKind.received"}, "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided an SMS message and wants me to parse it into a structured JSON according to the given rules. Let me start by understanding the input.\n\nThe input JSON has the channel as \"sms\", sender as \"JX-CULTFT-P\", body with a message about a Cultpass payment pending, date in ISO format, and type as received. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the transaction_type. The body says the payment is pending. According to the classification rules, if it's a pending transaction, message_intent should be \"pending_confirmation\" and transaction_type should be omitted. So, I'll set message_intent to \"pending_confirmation\" and not include transaction_type.\n\nNext, the amount. The body doesn't mention any numerical value, so amount is missing. Balance isn't mentioned either. The currency defaults to INR, but since there's no amount, I'll skip currency unless required. Wait, the output requires currency to be present except when not confidently available. Wait, the output says \"currency\": \"INR\" is required, but the note says if a field isn't confidently available, omit it. Wait, looking back: the output JSON says \"currency\" is required? Wait, no. The output JSON fields are optional except for currency. Wait, the user wrote: \"fields optional except currency\". So currency must be present. But in this case, the message doesn't mention an amount or currency. Wait, the rules say to default to INR for Indian SMS. The sender is \"JX-CULTFT-P\", which might be a service related to Cultpass, possibly in India. So even though the amount isn't mentioned, the currency is INR by default. But the amount is missing. Wait, the amount field is required? Wait, the output JSON says \"fields optional except currency\". So currency is mandatory, but others are optional. However, the amount is part of the transaction details. Wait, the output JSON includes \"amount\" as a field. But the note says if a field isn't confidently available, omit it. So if the amount isn't present in the message, we should omit it. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If a field is not confidently available, omit the field entirely.\" So for amount, since it's not mentioned, we omit it. But the currency is required. Wait, the output JSON says \"currency\": \"INR\" is required. Wait, the user's output JSON example has \"currency\": \"INR\" as a required field. So even if the amount isn't present, we need to include currency as INR. Wait, but the user's instruction says \"fields optional except currency\". So currency is mandatory, but others are optional. So even if the amount isn't present, we need to include currency. But the amount is not present here. So in the output, we'll have \"currency\": \"INR\" but omit \"amount\".\n\nNext, transaction_date: the input date is \"2025-07-02T11:36:36.235\", which is ISO 8601, so we can use that as the transaction_date.\n\nAccount: The message doesn't mention any account details, so omit account.\n\nCounterparty: The message mentions \"Cultpass\", which is the service, so counterparty could be \"Cultpass\" or \"Cultpass Service\". But the rules say counterparty is payee/payer/merchant/origin. Since it's a payment pending, the counterparty is likely the merchant, which is Cultpass.\n\nBalance: Not mentioned, so omit.\n\nCategory: The message is about a payment pending for a service, so category could be \"subscription\" or \"other\". Since it's a subscription service, maybe \"subscription\".\n\nTags: Maybe \"pending\", \"subscription\", \"payment\".\n\nSummary: \"Cultpass payment pending\" â€“ under 10 words.\n\nConfidence score: Since the message is about a pending payment, but the exact amount isn't mentioned, confidence is around 0.70-0.89. Let's say 0.8.\n\nMessage_intent: \"pending_confirmation\" as per the rules.\n\nMetadata: Include the original text, sender, method (maybe \"Other\" since it's a service), reference_id (not present), folio and scheme (not applicable here). So metadata will have channel, sender, method as \"Other\", original_text as the body.\n\nPutting it all together, the output JSON should have:\n\n- transaction_type: omitted\n- amount: omitted\n- currency: \"INR\"\n- transaction_date: \"2025-07-02T11:36:36.235\"\n- counterparty: \"Cultpass\"\n- category: \"subscription\"\n- tags: [\"pending\", \"subscription\", \"payment\"]\n- summary: \"Cultpass payment pending\"\n- confidence_score: 0.8\n- message_intent: \"pending_confirmation\"\n- metadata: {channel, sender, method: \"Other\", original_text: body}\n\nWait, the original_text is the body. Also, the sender in metadata is the sender from the input, which is \"JX-CULTFT-P\". The method is \"Other\" since it's a service message. Reference_id isn't present, so omit. Folio and scheme are for mutual funds, so not applicable here.\n\nSo the final JSON should have those fields. Let me check again for any missed rules. The message_intent is \"pending_confirmation\", which is correct. The category is \"subscription\" as it's a recurring service. Tags are concise. Confidence is 0.8. All other fields are omitted where not present. The currency is INR as default. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"currency\": \"INR\",\n  \"transaction_date\": \"2025-07-02T11:36:36.235\",\n  \"counterparty\": \"Cultpass\",\n  \"category\": \"subscription\",\n  \"tags\": [\"pending\", \"subscription\", \"payment\"],\n  \"summary\": \"Cultpass payment pending\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.8,\n  \"message_intent\": \"pending_confirmation\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"channel\": \"sms\",\n    \"sender\": \"JX-CULTFT-P\",\n    \"method\": \"Other\",\n    \"original_text\": \"Hey Divyam\\nYour Cultpass payment is still pending.
